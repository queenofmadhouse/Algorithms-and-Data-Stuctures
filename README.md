# Algorithms and Data Structures

Welcome to my repository dedicated to Algorithms and Data Structures. This is a comprehensive collection of problems and solutions that I have tackled, aiming to share my learning journey, practice, and insights with others who are interested in this field.

## Here's what you can expect:

- My solutions to a wide range of topics including:
  - Arrays and strings
  - Hashing
  - Linked lists
  - Stacks and queues
  - Trees and graphs
  - Heaps
  - Greedy algorithms
  - Binary search
  - Backtracking
  - Dynamic programming
- Each problem comes with a detailed description of the task, as well as my personal solutions. I've done my best to opt for the most efficient, optimal solutions to help you understand the logic and strategy behind each problem.
- Regular updates and new problems/solutions added to keep the repository relevant and continuously growing.

This repository is an invaluable resource for anyone looking to understand, learn, and practice algorithms and data structures - be it for your course, coding interviews, or just intellectual curiosity.

Your feedback and contributions are always welcome. Happy coding! :3
