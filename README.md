# Algorithms Challenge Repository [day 5 of 30]

> This repository is a challenge. Its purpose is to solve all algorithms and write data structures within exactly one month.

### What is it for?
I already have a pretty good knowledge of Java, but I wanted to delve into algorithms and data structures in more detail.

### All my solutions to problems by topic:

- Arrays and strings
- Hashing
- Linked lists
- Stacks and queues
- Trees and graphs
- Heaps
- Greedy
- Binary search
- Backtracking
- Dynamic programming

You can find even more solutions in my [**Leetcode**](https://leetcode.com/queenofmadhouse/) profile
